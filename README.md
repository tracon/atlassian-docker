# Tracon's Atlassian software setup

We run Crowd, Confluence and JIRA with some configuration particulars:

* Crowd is used to provide single sign on for Confluence and JIRA
* Confluence and JIRA are configured to perform login via [Kompassi](https://github.com/tracon/kompassi)
* All software is executed in Docker containers

This repository serves as example configuration for others who are facing similar setups. Work in progress.

## Try it out locally

    docker-compose up

## Deploy it for production

See [ansible-tracon](https://github.com/tracon/ansible-tracon).
